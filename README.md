Conducted a comprehensive project on Bayesian Multilevel Modeling, including data preprocessing, feature engineering on the data and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data. Developed linear and multilevel models using default priors, Gelman et al. priors, and horseshoe priors, followed by power scale sensitivity analysis to analyse prior data conflict and posterior predictive checks. Performed k-fold cross-validation and Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation for model validation. Selected the best model based on LOO comparison and random mean square error (RMSE), demonstrating expertise in Bayesian inference methods.
